# How to Contribute

import LinkBlank from '../../src/components/Docs/LinkBlank.tsx';

Have an idea for a guide or code sample? Awesome!

Before you submit an idea via our <LinkBlank link="https://github.com/zhaluza/best-practices-fullstack" text="repo"/>, **please read the following sections first.**

## What We Aren't
- We aren't a substitution for documentation. Make sure the topic you're proposing isn't covered in the respective documentation.
    - However, you can expand on documentation, such as by explaining how to implement a library or pattern in a complete app â€” e.g. how to implement React's Context API to provide a robust amount of data to a full React app.
    - You can also include some examples similar to those found in documentation, *if* you're including it in a comparison of similar libraries (e.g. different form libraries).
- We aren't a "tips and tricks" site (<LinkBlank link="https://dev.to" text="Dev" /> and <LinkBlank link="https://css-tricks.com/" text="CSS Tricks" /> are great places to contribute if this is what you had in mind).

## Acceptable Submission Formats
We accept three types of submissions:
1. Guide + Code
2. Guide
3. Code
