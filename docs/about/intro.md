# What Is Fullstack Best Practices?

Fullstack Best Practices is a collection of recipes describing modern,
up-to-date patterns used in fullstack JavaScript development.

If you ever wanted to know the best way to structure your Express app, which
React form library to use, or whether you should use a database client, query
builder, or ORM, you've come to the right place.

Each piece of content here answers at least one of the following questions:

- What's the right library for this common use case (e.g. building a form,
  connecting to a SQL database)?
- What's an efficient way to integrate this library into my app?
- How should I structure my app?

Think of us as the engineer you can always reach out to for an opinion on how
to put your app together.
